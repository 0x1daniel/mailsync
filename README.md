# mailsync :mailbox_with_mail:

the place for all your mails

## About

`mailsync` will be an tool to combine and backup all you mails into a single
interface. This will help you keeping track of your mails, reduce storage usage
on the real mail servers to receive new emails and to simplify the complex
multi-client use into a single client.

###### Still in development

## Goals

This project has the following goal:

- **Simplicity**: There will be no complex interface or a lot of functions as
supported by other email clients. If you have any issues with connecting to your
server, and it is probably an configuration bug, please open a new ticket.
- **Security**: Your account passwords will be requested after each restart of
the server, in order to avoid saving your passwords on the server. They will be
only used once to authenticate to the mail server.
